3	[1]	"Through history, most people didn't die of cancer or heart disease, the lifestyle diseases that are common in the Western world today. This is mostly because people didn't live long enough to develop them. They died of injuries -- being gored by an ox, shot on a battlefield, crushed in one of the new factories of the Industrial Revolution -- and most of the time from infection, which followed those injuries.

That changed when antibiotics were discovered. In 1928, Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, a drug still used today to fight bacterial infections. Suddenly, infections that had been a death sentence became remedied within days. During World War II, this drug treated pneumonia and sepsis, and has been estimated to have saved between 12-15% of Allied Forces lives. We have been living inside the golden epoch of the miracle drugs, and now, we are coming to an end of it.

People are dying of infections again because of a phenomenon called antibiotic resistance, or popularly referred to as “superbugs”. Bacteria compete against each other for resources, for food, by manufacturing lethal compounds that they direct against each other. When we first made antibiotics, we took those compounds into the lab and made our own versions of them, and bacteria responded to our attack the way they always had.

For 70 years, we played a game of leapfrog -- our drug and their resistance, and then another drug, and then resistance again -- and now the game is ending. Bacteria develop resistance so quickly that pharmaceutical companies have decided making antibiotics is not in their best interest, so there are infections moving across the world for which, out of the more than 100 antibiotics available on the market, two drugs might work with side effects, or one drug, or none.

It would be natural to hope that these infections are extraordinary cases, but in fact, in the United States and Europe, 50 thousand people a year die of infections which no drugs can help. A project chartered by the British government known as the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance estimates that the worldwide toll right now is 700 thousand deaths a year. Also, if we can't get this under control by 2050, the worldwide toll will be 10 million deaths a year (more than the current population of New York City).

The scale of antibiotic resistance seems overwhelming, but if you've ever bought a fluorescent light bulb because you were concerned about climate change, you already know what it feels like to take a tiny step to address an overwhelming problem. We could take those kinds of steps for antibiotic use too. We could forgo giving an antibiotic for our kids’ ear infection, if we're not sure it's the right one. And we could promise each other to never again to buy chicken or shrimp or fruit raised with routine antibiotic use. If we did those things, we could slow down the arrival of the post-antibiotic world.

"	There have been so many deaths throughout history from disease, but it seems like more people are dying of disease now because people hundreds of years ago often didn't live long enough to die of cancer or other illnesses. They were killed in factory accidents, or crushed by oxes and then dying from infection later on. This meant that fewer people got the opportunity to die of disease. In World War II and beyond, medicine has vastly improved and people are living longer than ever before. There are also about 50 thousands people who die each year who medicine couldn't help. Also, there is the problem of antibiotic resistance which bugs have adapted to. Despite this, people are still living longer and healthier lives.	0.0	2.0	Yes	4	1	2	No	No	10	7

A large number of people have died in the past, but much fewer of those people died from disease than those today. This is attributed to the fact that most people did not live nearly long enough to die from diseases such as cancer. They were killed in factory accidents or crushed by oxen or lived just enough to get injured and develop an untreated infection that ultimately kills them. Despite the field of medicine has had huge advancement since the second World War, over 50 thousand people from causes unpreventable by modern medicine. There is also the issue of resistance to antibiotics that several bugs developed. 	1.0	4.0	Yes	6	0	8			8	2
