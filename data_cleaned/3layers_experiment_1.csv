2	[1]	"Through history, most people didn't die of cancer or heart disease, the lifestyle diseases that are common in the Western world today. This is mostly because people didn't live long enough to develop them. They died of injuries -- being gored by an ox, shot on a battlefield, crushed in one of the new factories of the Industrial Revolution -- and most of the time from infection, which followed those injuries.

That changed when antibiotics were discovered. In 1928, Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, a drug still used today to fight bacterial infections. Suddenly, infections that had been a death sentence became remedied within days. During World War II, this drug treated pneumonia and sepsis, and has been estimated to have saved between 12-15% of Allied Forces lives. We have been living inside the golden epoch of the miracle drugs, and now, we are coming to an end of it.

People are dying of infections again because of a phenomenon called antibiotic resistance, or popularly referred to as “superbugs”. Bacteria compete against each other for resources, for food, by manufacturing lethal compounds that they direct against each other. When we first made antibiotics, we took those compounds into the lab and made our own versions of them, and bacteria responded to our attack the way they always had.

For 70 years, we played a game of leapfrog -- our drug and their resistance, and then another drug, and then resistance again -- and now the game is ending. Bacteria develop resistance so quickly that pharmaceutical companies have decided making antibiotics is not in their best interest, so there are infections moving across the world for which, out of the more than 100 antibiotics available on the market, two drugs might work with side effects, or one drug, or none.

It would be natural to hope that these infections are extraordinary cases, but in fact, in the United States and Europe, 50 thousand people a year die of infections which no drugs can help. A project chartered by the British government known as the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance estimates that the worldwide toll right now is 700 thousand deaths a year. Also, if we can't get this under control by 2050, the worldwide toll will be 10 million deaths a year (more than the current population of New York City).

The scale of antibiotic resistance seems overwhelming, but if you've ever bought a fluorescent light bulb because you were concerned about climate change, you already know what it feels like to take a tiny step to address an overwhelming problem. We could take those kinds of steps for antibiotic use too. We could forgo giving an antibiotic for our kids’ ear infection, if we're not sure it's the right one. And we could promise each other to never again to buy chicken or shrimp or fruit raised with routine antibiotic use. If we did those things, we could slow down the arrival of the post-antibiotic world.

"	"At the beginning, People died because of reasons like war wounded, accident and so external activities. that time there was no need of any drugs specially to treat. But, many due to bacterial infections, they have no idea on how to deal with this. Then later in world war 2, many people died because of this cause. After many efforts, In 1928, Alexander Fleming discovered an antibiotic to treat bacterial infection which is called as penicillin or antibacterial drug. Because of this many of them were saved. This drug helps in dealing the bacterial infection effectively. And so, It reduced the death rate of people due to bacterial infection around 12 - 15%. 
The drugs are so common now-a-days and we can find 100's of those drugs in market. Unfortunately, The drug which saved us in past is going in different direction of giving worse efforts to people. Many people are getting the side effects and in both US and Europe totally around 50 thousand were died per year.
British has taken the step to reduce or reverse the effects causing by the micro antibiotics and they noted 70 thousand people died a year. If we do not take required action by 2050, we will end up losing 10 million people which is more than the current population of New York city.
So we should deal with this as early as possible and avoid buying antibiotic shrimp or fruit and chicken and so. It will reduce the effect and rate of affects drastically.

"	Throughout history people died of different causes related to infection. In 1928 Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, saving countless lives. In World War 2 it save 10-12 percent of allied forces from dying from infections. Now however, bacteria is evolving as a result of these antibiotic and forming 'super-bugs'. It is estimated 700 thousand people a year die from bacterial infections and it could be as high as 10 million a year by 2050 if action isn't taken. If you have ever bought a florescent light bulb from the store you know what it is like to take one small action in an attempt in an attempt to reduce a major worldwide problem. Even if it involves washing your hands less or buying food products that have not been treated with antibiotics, there are actions you can take to improve this problem.  	0.0	2.0	Yes	6	1	5	no	no	10	2

"	Many people died for a lot of reasons like war and other illnesses, and they could not stop this .  Alexander Fleming then created penecillin and this helped save a lot people.  About 10-15% people of the troops in World war 2. Now lots of people use this drug and many other like it and it is very effective. But it has gone in a different direction and people are becoming resistant to the drugs, and people are starting to die.

This antibiotic helped to save thousands of people, and was used heavily in World War 2.  Yet, due to it's overuse, viruses are becoming resistant to it, and it takes more of the drug to fit off the illnesses.  If something is not done to help change how it is used, Superbugs will be able to resist many different antibiotics in the future.	2.0	6.0	Yes	6	2	4	No	No	10	2
