That changed when antibiotics were discovered. In 1928, Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, a drug still used today to fight bacterial infections. Suddenly, infections that had been a death sentence became remedied within days.

We have been living inside the golden epoch of the miracle drugs, and now, we are coming to an end of it.

People are dying of infections again because of a phenomenon called antibiotic resistance, or popularly referred to as “superbugs”. Bacteria compete against each other for resources, for food, by manufacturing lethal compounds that they direct against each other. When we first made antibiotics, we took those compounds into the lab and made our own versions of them, and bacteria responded to our attack the way they always had.

For 70 years, we played a game of leapfrog -- our drug and their resistance, and then another drug, and then resistance again -- and now the game is ending. Bacteria develop resistance so quickly that pharmaceutical companies have decided making antibiotics is not in their best interest, so there are infections moving across the world for which, out of the more than 100 antibiotics available on the market, two drugs might work with side effects, or one drug, or none.

It would be natural to hope that these infections are extraordinary cases, but in fact, in the United States and Europe, 50 thousand people a year die of infections which no drugs can help. A project chartered by the British government known as the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance estimates that the worldwide toll right now is 700 thousand deaths a year. Also, if we can't get this under control by 2050, the worldwide toll will be 10 million deaths a year (more than the current population of New York City).

The scale of antibiotic resistance seems overwhelming, but if you've ever bought a fluorescent light bulb because you were concerned about climate change, you already know what it feels like to take a tiny step to address an overwhelming problem. We could take those kinds of steps for antibiotic use too. We could forgo giving an antibiotic for our kids’ ear infection, if we're not sure it's the right one. And we could promise each other to never again to buy chicken or shrimp or fruit raised with routine antibiotic use. If we did those things, we could slow down the arrival of the post-antibiotic world.

People used to die from things like injuries, accidents and infections.  Death from infections was very common until antibiotics were discovered.  Then with the development of antibiotics people were surviving things at much higher rate.  Unfortunately as time went by, antibiotics were overused and also given to animals that would be eaten by humans.  Because of this, antibiotic resistance or ""super bugs"" started to emerge.  This basically meant that diseases were beginning to develop a resistance to the commonly prescribed antibiotics.  The only way to combat this is to stop using antibiotics unless absolutely necessary and to avoid eating animals that have been treated with antibiotics."

But, people started using them too much, as well as giving them to animals. People would also eat the animals that consumed the antibiotics, which lead to super bugs. Super bugs are infections that become resistant to antibiotics. The only way to combat this issue was to stop taking antibiotics so frequently and to stop consuming the animals that were treated with antibiotics. "

However, overuse of antibiotics led to the evolution of disease resistant superbugs.  That is, infections began to resist antibiotics.

People lived much shorter lives in part because they did not have the resources we do now to deal with infections and diseases, such as antibiotics and vaccines. Now we have those things and since we have been able to solve our infections with antibiotics instead of dying, our life span has generally increased. However at this point our use of antibiots has turned into overuse, to the point that superbugs have formed that are impervious to our antibiotic defenses. These antibiotics also tend to be in our meat supply. If we want to continue to be safe from infections we have to stop overusing antibiotics so that the infectious life forms don't become stronger than our antibiotic defenses"
